INSTRUCTIONS
----

1. Replace input.eu3 with the EU3 savegame file you want to convert (also rename it as input.eu3).

2. Run EU3toV2Converter.exe

3. This should generate a conversion file called output.v2

4. Copy output.v2 to your victoria 2 savegames directory and load the converted savegame in Victoria 2.

4. If it crashes, let me know.

NOTES
----

1. Currently, adding some province mappings results in an invalid save file. I am investigating as to why it's happening.

2. The province_mapping.txt file is used by the program.
