Q: I have an ironman save. Can it be converted?
A: Well in fact you can transform an ironman save into a normal save.
	1. Locate your ironman save on your computer. If it's on the cloud, there is a copy there : ..\Steam\userdata\<your account>\236850\remote\save games
	2. Copy it on the "local" save game directory and edit the copy with a software (notepad++ may be very useful)
	3. On the first line you will found the three letters of the tag of your nation (BYZ for example)
	4. Replace it with another : (FRA is a good one because the BBB is always around)
	5. Load the save. You will play as France
	6. Save it, change again the nation on the new save
	7. Load the save again and then save. This time you will notice that it's asking which name giving to this save, which implies it is no more ironman.
	8. TADAM ! It's no more ironman but a regular save
	Thanks to Helkoi for the technique!

Q: I loaded my mod, but nothing changed. What's wrong?
A: You probably placed the mod in the My Documents mod folder. It needs to go in the Vic2 install location's mod folder.

Q: Vic2 is crashing at converting history. What do I do?
A: Try going into the mod and deleting history/units. If it now loads, likely a navy got placed badly. Open up log.txt and search for warnings. If any mention whitelisting and blacklisting, open port_blacklist.txt and add the provinces in the warnings to file file. Save it and reconvert. Repeat checking for the warnings and adding the provinces until there are no more warnings. You should now get a working mod. Make sure to inform the team of any provinces you had to add so we can include them in future releases.

Q: Vic2 is crashing at Initializing Maplogic. What do I do?
A: Clear your map cache by deleting the cache folder inside ".../victoria 2/map/" in both My Documents and the Victoria 2 install location.

Q: The converter crashes after no time with no errors and no log.txt (when running through the frontend). What went wrong?
A: This is the MSVCP120.dll error from earlier in the FAQ. Use that solution.

Q: The converter says my save is compressed. What do I do?
A: You'll need to save it again in EU4. When you do, the save dialog has an option to compress the save. Make sure it is not selected.

Q: The converter says my save is ironman. What do I do?
A: Use the technique listed above.
