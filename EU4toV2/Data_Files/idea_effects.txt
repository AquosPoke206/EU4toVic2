# This file allows EU4 ideas to have various effects in the conversion
#	* army_investment, commerce_investment, culture_investmeny, industry_investment, and navy_investment 
#		affect which tech school a nation starts with. Each levle of the idea (including simply having the idea) influences
#		the investment by the amount specified.
#	* upper_house_liberal and upper_house_reactionary affect the upper house a nation starts with.
#		Each level of the idea (including simply having the idea) increases the amount of liberal or reactionary by the
#		amount specified.
#	* NV_order, NV_liberty, and NV_equality affect the (V2) national idea a nation starts with. Each level of the (EU4) idea
#		(including simply having the idea) increases the "score" for the (v2) idea by the specified amount, and completing
#		the (EU4) idea gives an additional point.
#	* literacy is a list of the idea levels that will each give a 10% increase to literacy
